This is a branch for Python miniprojects created by me.

Here I will upload my miniprojects, which I created by learning and practicing new Python techniques and methods.

I am a newcomer in Python and constantly practicing Python programming, hoping that I will master this programming language one day.

As Python is one of the most versatile and best programming languages,
I am interested in boosting my career in Python and researching and making new interesting projects in Python in the future.
